## v0.01.000 - AUDIO!
	- Added audio sources
		- File stream sources & Fully decoded sources
		- 16-bit int & 32-bit float support
		- WAV & OGG support (in-house wav decoder, stb_vorbis for ogg)
		- Usage:
			bool audio_open_source_stream(*src, path, allocator)
			bool audio_open_source_load(*src, path, allocator)
			void audio_source_destroy(*src)
	- Added audio playback
		- The simple way:
			play_one_audio_clip_source(source);
			play_one_audio_clip(path);
		- With Audio_Player:
			audio_player_get_one();
			audio_player_release(*player);
			audio_player_set_state(*player, state);
			audio_player_set_time_stamp(*player, time_in_seconds);
			audio_player_set_progression_factor(*player, factor);
			audio_player_get_time_stamp(*player);
			audio_player_get_current_progression_factor(*player);
			audio_player_set_source(*player, src, bool retain_progression_factor);

			audio_player_set_looping(*player, bool looping);
	- Added some basic features in the audio system
		- Conversion & resampling between audio formats
		- Automatically detects new default device
		- Small fade in pause/play for less noise from sudden changes in playback buffer
	- Added a audio_test.c example
	- More OS procuedres
		- os_file_set_pos(file, pos)

		- os_file_get_size(file)
		- os_get_stack_trace(allocator)
	- Misc
		- Win32 audio impl
		- Link to more win32 junk
		- Make default logger thread safe
		- Rename tm_scope_cycles & tm_scope_cycles_xxx -> tm_scope & tm_scope_xxx
		- Minor cleanups

		- lerpf, lerpi, smerpf, smerpi
		- Failed asserts now prints the stack trace.
		

## v0.00.005 - Z layers

Renderer:
	- Added optional Z-sorting
		- Either set quad->z or call push_z_layer(s64) (and pop_z_layer())
		- Enable with draw_frame.enable_z_sorting = true
	- Refactored the quad buffering to just be a growing quad buffer rather than a linked list of quad blocks. Your CPU will be thankful.
	- Fixed crashing when D3D11 DEBUG flag fails in ID3D11CreateDevice, and instead log a descriptive error then continue as usual
	
Misc:
	- removed gfx_impl_legacy_opengl.c
	- Sorting procedures
		- merge_sort()
		- radix_sort()
	- sorting tests

## v0.00.004 - Custom logging, more concurrency & bugfixing

Concurrency:
	- Refactored spinlock out of OS api (deprecated old procs)
	- Concurrency utilites:
		void spinlock_init(Spinlock *l);
		void spinlock_acquire_or_wait(Spinlock* l);
		bool spinlock_acquire_or_wait_timeout(Spinlock* l, f64 timeout_seconds);
		void spinlock_release(Spinlock* l);
		void mutex_init(Mutex *m);
		void mutex_destroy(Mutex *m);
		void mutex_acquire_or_wait(Mutex *m);
		void mutex_release(Mutex *m);
		void binary_semaphore_init(Binary_Semaphore *sem, bool initial_state);
		void binary_semaphore_destroy(Binary_Semaphore *sem);
		void binary_semaphore_wait(Binary_Semaphore *sem);
		void binary_semaphore_signal(Binary_Semaphore *sem);
		Macro MEMORY_BARRIER
	- Concurrency tests
	
Docs:
	- custom_logger.c example to show how one can make a custom logger and have logs displayed in-game

Utility:
	- draw_text_and_measure() which is just an overload of draw_text but it also does a measure and returns it

Misc:
	- Added u64 thread_id to global context. This is set in main() for main thread and in thread startup when you dispatch a Thread
	- Fixed a bug where plain rects would be drawn with the incorrect color
	- Fixed a bug where quads from earlier frames would be drawn

## v0.00.003 - Fixes

Random:
	- get_random_float64()
	- get_random_float32_in_range()
	- get_random_float64_in_range()
	- get_random_int_in_range()

Third party:
	- Added 3 minimal libraries for audio decoding
		- dr_mp3.h: MP3 decoding
		- dr_wav.h: WAV decoding
		- stb_vorbis.c: OGG decoding
	- Made a global thread_local "third_party_allocator" which is set when third party libraries are used so all memory still goes through our *program_memory
	- Stripped all third party libraries of external dependencies (C headers) & noise

Memory:
	- Improved assert messages to be more clear about what might be happening if they fail
	- Added more checks in debug to detect heap corruption and what not
	- Fixed a bug where the program would crash because a heap block was perfectly full

Misc:
	- Fixed typos in examples/text_rendering.c
	- Fixed Y placement of window when changing the window rect
	- Fixed window sizing when setting scaled_width or scaled_height
	- Updated readme
	- Portable DEPRECATED macro
	- Deprecate os_compare_and_swap and replace with more portable compare_and_swap
	- Fixed a bug where the wrong image would be drawn

## v0.00.002 - Text rendering, image manipulation, hash tables

Renderer:
	- Pass 8-bit integers "type" and "sampler_index" to shader
		- Sample texture differently depending on "type" (text or regular quad)
		- Sample with nearest/linear min/mag depending on sampler_index
		- Set min/mag filtering in Draw_Quad
		- Images are now created and deleted directly with gfx calls rather than deferring it for gfx_update.
		- We can now set image sub data with gfx_set_image_data()
		- Images are no longer hard coded to 4 channels
		
Text/Fonts:
	- Added font loading with lazy initialization/rasterization when it's needed
		- Load & rasterize any fonts with load_font_from_disk()
		- Fonts automatically rasterize glyphs into atlases and generate metrics on the fly
		- Measure text for very_useful metrics with measure_text()
		- Walk over glyphs and their metrics with walk_glyphs()
	- Implemented simple but powerful text rendering
		- Draw text with draw_text() or draw_text_xform()
	- See oogabooga/examples/text_rendering.c for more
			
Other:
	- Added 3 simple hash functions:
		- 64-bit xx_hash(): Very fast hash for 64-bit values
		- 64-bit city_hash(): Very fast hash for short strings
		- 64-bit djb2_hash(): Fast hash for strings longer than 32 bytes
		- Made a generic get_hash() macro to detect the type you are trying to hash and call the approriate procedure
	- Introduced a simple (kinda slow) hash table with following procedures:
		- hash_table_add
		- hash_table_find
		- hash_table_contains
		- hash_table_set
		See hash_table.c for more information.
	- Utf8 utility:
		- utf8_to_utf32(): convert utf8 bytes to a single u32 codepoint
		- next_utf8(): Convert first utf8 character in a string to a u32 codepoint and advance the passed string to the next unicode
	- Renamed m4_multiply -> m4_mul for consistency
	- Refactored os window to be DPI aware
		- Window now has scaled_width, scaled_height which is the DPI-scaled size. Previous window.width & window.height are now aliased as window.pixel_height and window.pixel_width for clarity
	- in minimal example, renamed hammer_xform -> rect_xform
