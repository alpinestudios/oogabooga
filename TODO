- Audio
	- Avoid playing identical audio at the same time
	- Allow audio programming
		- Inject mixer proc per player
		- Inject a mixer proc before and after filling output buffer
	- Better spacialization
	- Fix vorbis >FILE< streaming (#StbVorbisFileStream)
	- Handle audio sources which had their format defaulted to update when default device changes
		For streamed audio sources this should be easy enough, because the conversion happens from raw format to source format as we stream it.
		For loaded sources though, we would need to convert the source->pcm_frames.
	- Optimize
		- Spam simd
		- Concurrent jobs for players?
		- Mega buffer for contiguous intermediate buffers
			We definitely also want a limit to how much memory we want allocated to intermediate buffers.
	- Bugs:
		- Small fadeout on pause is slightly noisy
		- Setting time stamp/progression causes noise (need fade transition like on pause/play)
		- End of clip also causes noise if audio clip does not end smoothly
		- Setting audio source to a format which differs from audio output format in both channels and bit_width at the same time will produce pure loud noise.
		- 24-Bit audio conversion doesn't really work
		- Converting 24-bit audio files doesn't really work
			
- General bugs & issues
	- Release freeze in run_tests
	- Window width&height is zero when minimized (and we make a 0x0 swap chain)
	- Window positioning & sizing is fucky wucky
	- Memory error messages are misleading when no VERY_DEBUG
	
- Renderer
	- API to pass constant values to shader (codegen #define's)
		
- Fonts
	- Atlases are way too big, render atlases with size depending on font_height (say, 128 codepoints per atlas)
	
- OS
	- Window::bool is_minimized
	- don't set window.width & window.height to 0
	- Sockets recv, send
	
	
- Arenas
	
- Needs testing:
	- Audio format channel conversions
	- sample rate downsampling
	- non stereo or mono audio
	- Audio spacialization on anything that's not stereo
